# Tensorflow
My journey towards becoming a tensorflow developer

## In the 00_tensorflow python notebook , 
i learned the different ways of representing tensor , what tensor is in the first place , simple operations on tensors and their ease of use and interconvertability with numpy , the basic data analyis functions in the tensorflow api . :) ... 

## In the 01_tensorflow notebook and 02_tensorflow notebook, 
i learned how to perform regression and classification using tensorflow keras , preprocessing data , evaluating models , tuning hyperparameters , improving the models using several techniques , visualize everything and so on , on self and real life data sets ;)

## In the 03 notebook , 
i learned to apply computer vision using tensorflow on the 101 food dataset , both binary and multiclass classification was done , models were improved with every step , overfitting was fit using data augmentation , data was preprocessed using imagedatagenerator function of tensorflow keras.image api ..''..

# HAPPY LEARNING
